# ANTLR4-Calculator
An ANTLR4 calculator is a simple application that uses ANTLR4 to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions. It involves defining a grammar for arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), which ANTLR4 uses to generate a lexer and parser.
The calculator can then process input expressions (e.g., "3 + 5 * (2 - 8)") by parsing the tokens, constructing a parse tree, and evaluating the result. This is done by writing a Python program that utilizes the generated lexer and parser to perform the computations and output the result.

Files Overview:
Calc.g4: The ANTLR grammar file defining the rules for arithmetic operations.
CalcLexer.py: Generated lexer class for tokenizing input expressions.
CalcParser.py: Generated parser class for processing tokenized input and building a parse tree.
CalcListener.py: Listener class that provides methods for reacting to the nodes of the parse tree.
CalcLexer.tokens: The list of tokens used by the lexer.
Calc.tokens: The token stream generated by the lexer.
Calc.interp: Intermediate file generated during parsing.
CalcLexer.interp: Lexer-specific interpretation file.
pycache: Contains the compiled Python files for the lexer and parser.
calc_evaluator.py: Python file that evaluates the parse tree and computes the result of the arithmetic expression.
calc_test.py: Test file that runs example expressions and prints results.

Prerequisites:
1. Java: Install JDK 11 or higher.
Install Java:
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
2. Verify installation:
java -version
3. Python 3: Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed.
Install Python 3:
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

Installation:
Download ANTLR4: Download the ANTLR4 jar file:
wget https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar

Set up the environment:
Add ANTLR to your ~/.bashrc file:
export CLASSPATH=".:$HOME/antlr/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"
alias antlr4='java -jar ~/antlr/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar'
alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'

Reload .bashrc:
source ~/.bashrc

Usage:
Generate Lexer and Parser: From the command line, run the following command to generate Python files from the grammar:

antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 Calc.g4

Run the Calculator:
Run calc_test.py to evaluate an expression.
python3 calc_test.py
The input expression will be parsed and evaluated by the program, which will print the result.

Example:
To evaluate an expression like 3 + 5 * (2 - 8), enter it when prompted and the program will output the result.
